        <ion-card-title>Stewarding</ion-card-title>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>One of the best ways to get involved with the Union is stewarding our events. Stewards wear a
        fetching neon jacket,
        get the best seats in the house, a £5 bar tab and a free grilled sandwich per event stewarded. So what are you
        waiting
        for? Join ‘Cambridge Union Society Stewards’ on Facebook or reach out to <a
          href="mailto:christian.owen@cus.org">christian.owen@cus.org</a> for more details.</ion-card-content>

        <ion-card-title>AV Stewarding</ion-card-title>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>Much like regular stewarding, AV stewarding is a fantastic opportunity to get involved with the
        Society. AV Stewards are trained to work the cameras and microphones during events for our livestream and
        Youtube. Not only do you get the same £5 bar tab and grilled sandwich as the regular stewards, you also get to
        learn valuable skills. Join ‘Cambridge Union AV Stewards’ or email <a
          href="mailto:audiovisual@cus.org">audiovisual@cus.org</a> for more details.

        <ion-card-title>Participating in Debates</ion-card-title>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>Our weekly debates also offer our members a chance to speak alongside and debate with these
        figures themselves. Every Saturday we host open auditions for one or two of the six spaces in the following
        week’s debate - sign up and come along! The specific slots and debates open for audition are subject to change -
        check emails and Facebook to stay up to date. New debaters are encouraged to apply. Additionally, two floor
        speeches per week are awarded a prize with a value of approximately £150, so we encourage everyone to join the
        discussion.</ion-card-content>

        <ion-card-title>Being Appointed</ion-card-title>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>At the end of each term, the incoming team of officers interviews people for a variety of
        positions on Full Committee, all of which are advertised via email, and in the Union’s Facebook Group. There are
        roles for anyone and everyone, regardless of experience, so do keep an eye out for the end of Michaelmas which
        is when the Lent team will start recruiting. Union experience is not required to apply for these roles.

        <ion-card-title>Running for Election</ion-card-title>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>Each term elections are held for the position of President, Executive Officer, Speakers Officer,
        Treasure and Social Ents Officer. To run for election, one must satisfy a few criteria that can be found in the
        Union’s constitution on our website. Most of these involve supporting the Union’s competitive debating programme
        in a variety of ways. Running for President requires that one has previously been head of a department at the
        union.</ion-card-content>

        <ion-card-title>Competitive Debating</ion-card-title>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>One of the most exciting things Union membership has to offer is the chance to get involved in
        competitive debating. Debating can change lives in the most wonderful ways – the skills you learn will be useful
        in countless situations, from essay writing to interviews. Debating at Cambridge can also bring you
        opportunities to travel the world at a substantial discount, and, we believe, to make friendships that will last
        a lifetime.<br><br>Now is an amazing time to get involved with the debating society! We’ve had consistent
        success at
        the world’s biggest competitions over the last few years. Most recently, we won the European University Debating
        Championships in Athens this summer, with our top two teams both performing absolutely exceptionally! If you
        begin debating, you’ll have many opportunities to learn from and to speak with these debaters, and to improve
        your own skills.<br><br>How do I get involved?<br><br>We have a new freshers’ programme launching this term! To
        meet us and sign up for our workshops, please come along to some or all of these events:
        <ol>
          <li>Debating launch! 9th October, 19:30-21.00. Come meet the society, watch a light-hearted show debate from
            our top debaters, and share some drinks afterwards.</li>
          <li>Beginners’ introduction session – for novices only! 12th October, 18:00-21:00. This is for people who have
            very limited experience debating. We will teach you the basic principles of debating, a few features of the
            British Parliamentary format, and we will make sure anybody who wants to will have an opportunity to try out
            speaking for themselves. In this way, everybody can get some experience debating before the streaming
            session for squads!</li>
          <li>Squad allocation! 14th October, 18:00-21:00. An evening of debating to show off your skills! Everybody
            will get the opportunity to speak, after which we’ll separate into workshop groups based on ability level
            for the rest of the term.</li>
          <li>Weekly workshops! Groups of a similar ability will be grouped together to work together all term. Each
            group will beallocated one of the Union’s most experienced debaters as their trainer!</li>
        </ol><br>
        Please note that there is no requirement to come to all of these events to join a workshop group for this term!
        We’ll post a sign-up form online as well.<br><br>More dates for your diary:<br><br>
